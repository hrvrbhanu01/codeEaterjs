# Stream and Buffer
Dividing data into smaller-smaller chunks and sent it 
We use 'Buffer' to do that:
Buffers basically stores those small chunks of data(as various stacks of data)
e.g. Buffer is like a tap in a water Pipe connected to a water tanker.
>> In output of terminal you'll see as :
<Buffer 6d 73 67 3d 64 61 74 61> ; where 6d 73 67 etc are data chunks in the Buffer.


## express
we create middleware ;data(req,res,next)=>{.....}
then this middleware sends it to another middleware; next()
then that middleware sends the response data; res.send()

# app.use() : helps in passing the middleware function
>>next is a function provided by express to call other middleware functions
